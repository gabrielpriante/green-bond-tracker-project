# Green Bond Project Tracker

A lightweight, open-source tracker for green bonds and sustainability-linked projects with GIS (Geographic Information System) support. Designed for learning, transparency, and portfolio-level insights.

**⚠️ Educational Notice:** This is an educational project for learning purposes only. It is NOT intended for investment advice or financial decision-making. Always consult qualified financial advisors before making investment decisions.

## Features

- 📊 **Data Management**: Load and validate green bond data with ISO country codes
- 🗺️ **GIS Integration**: Visualize bond data on interactive choropleth maps
- 📈 **Analytics**: Generate summary statistics and time series analysis
- 📓 **Demo Notebook**: Comprehensive Jupyter notebook with examples
- ✅ **Data Validation**: Ensure data quality and completeness

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/gabrielpriante/green-bond-tracker-project.git
cd green-bond-tracker-project

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

```python
from src.data_loader import (
    load_green_bonds,
    load_country_geometries,
    join_bonds_with_geo,
    get_summary_statistics
)

# Load data
bonds = load_green_bonds()
countries = load_country_geometries()

# Get statistics
stats = get_summary_statistics(bonds)
print(f"Total bonds: {stats['total_bonds']}")
print(f"Total amount: ${stats['total_amount_usd_millions']:.2f}M USD")

# Create geographic dataset
geo_bonds = join_bonds_with_geo(bonds, countries)
```

### Run the Demo Notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/green_bond_demo.ipynb
```

The demo notebook includes:
- Data loading and validation
- Summary statistics
- Use of proceeds analysis
- Geographic choropleth maps
- Time series analysis
- Certification standard analysis
